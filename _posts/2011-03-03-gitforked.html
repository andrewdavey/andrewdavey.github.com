title: Git Forked
---
<p>I now use <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a> almost exclusively as my project hosting provider. I have open source and private projects hosted there. GitHub really encourages the social aspects of open source. They also provide plenty of hand-holding while I'm still learning git.</p>
<p>As the creator of open source projects, the thing I hope for most is people getting involved. I want people to fork a project, edit the code and submit pull requests. So I created <a href="http://gitforked.com/">gitforked.com</a>.</p>
<p>Git Forked creates social media style "fork" buttons that link to your GitHub repository page. You can put these buttons on your home page, blog, etc. The number of forks is shown next to the button, just like the numbers of tweets next to a Twitter tweet button.</p>
<p>Here's an example button: <a href="https://github.com/andrewdavey/postal" class="gitforked-button">Fork</a></p>
<p>So head over to <a href="http://gitforked.com/">gitforked.com</a>, enter your repository URL and generate your very own fork button!</p>
