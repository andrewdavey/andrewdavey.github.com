<p>
I was recently given a copy of a <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/twitter-bootstrap-web-development/book">Twitter Bootstrap Web Development How-To</a> to review.
</p>
<p>
The book provides an introduction to <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/index.html">Twitter Bootstrap</a>.
Its step-by-step style walks the reader through the basics of getting started.
You'll learn how to create and customize a variety of different page layouts and enhance these using some of
Bootstrap's built-in jQuery plugins.
</p>
<p>
If you're new to web development and find online documentation a bit terse when learning new libraries, 
then this book is worth a quick read.
