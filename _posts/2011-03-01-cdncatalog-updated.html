<p>If you're building a modern website then you'll be needing some javascript libraries and css.</p>
<p>I've updated <a href="http://cdncatalog.com/">CDNCatalog.com</a> with links to all the latest javascript and css resources hosted by Google, Microsoft, etc.</p>
<p>The website now has easy one-click icons to copy either the URL or HTML snippet for a resource.</p>
<p>So take a look and tell your friends!</p>
