title: MVC routing for public facing web applications
---
<p>
    When building a public web application with ASP.NET MVC, I often want to divide
    the project into three major parts.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>The publicly visible, marketing website with about pages, product tour, contact
        info, sign up, etc.</li>
    <li>The actual application, secured behind a login form.</li>
    <li>A system admin area, so I can manage user accounts, monitor reports, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>
    Areas, in MVC 2 and better, make it easy to slice up the three parts of the web
    application. Read on learn how I set this up and get some useful tips you can use
    for your own applications.
</p>
<h2>
    Everything is an Area</h2>
<p>
    You probably want the public marketing pages to live at the root of your URL structure.
    So it's tempting to put the controllers and views into the top-level Controllers
    and Views folders. Don't do this. I don't see why the marketing junk should get
    special treatment. It's an area just like the application and the system admin areas.</p>
<p>
    So add three areas to your MVC project called "Public", "App", and "Admin". The
    default route registration for these is mostly OK, except for Public. We don't want
    "public" in the URLs. However, simply editing the route registration for Public
    will cause a potential routing failure. The order of route registration matters.</p>
<p>
    If, by chance, the Public area is registered before the other two, then its default
    route of "{controller}/{action}/{id}" will greedily steal any URL heading for App
    or Admin. For example, the URL "app/home/index" would end up looking for a controller
    in Public called "AppController" and an action method called "Home". This is not
    what we intended!</p>
<p>
    To remedy the situation we must force the Public area to general route to be added
    after all other areas. Cut it out of the PublicAreaRegistration.cs file. Move it
    to Application_Start in Global.asax, after the call to AreaRegistration.RegisterAllAreas.</p>
<p>
    Then make the following changes to make it still behave as an Area route:</p>
<code>
    <pre class="brush: csharp">AreaRegistration.RegisterAllAreas(); // Force App and Admin to run first
<strong>var publicRoute =</strong> routes.MapRoute(
    "PublicRoute",
    "{controller}/{action}/{id}",
    new { controller = "Home", action = "Index", id = UrlParameter.Optional },
    <strong>new[] { typeof(Areas.Public.Controllers.HomeController).Namespace }</strong>
);
<strong>publicRoute.DataTokens["Area"] = "Public";</strong></pre>
</code>
<p>
    This gives the route the correct namespace to look for controllers and assigns the
    Area name.</p>
<p>
    URLs heading for App and Admin will reach their intended destinations. You can still
    keep custom routes in Public's registration. Just make sure they aren't too general,
    capturing URLs for areas.</p>
