title: Load images with jQuery Deferred
layout: post

<p>
Have you ever needed to know the dimensions of an image in JavaScript?
In the past, you may have used code like this:
</p>
<pre class="brush: js">var image = new Image();
image.onload = function() {
  alert("Loaded image: " + image.width + "x" + image.height);
};
image.src = "/my-image.png";</pre>
<p>
This is okay for very basic scenarios, but it becomes tricky to handle things like:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Notifying more than one part of your application when the image is loaded</li>
  <li>Error handling</li>
  <li>Loading multiple images in parallel</li>
  <li>Chaining together a sequence of asynchronous operations</li>
</ul>
<p>
I also dislike the backwards nature of writing the callback function <em>before</em>
assigning the <code>src</code> property. This is essential however, because 
image loading is asynchronous and could potentially finish before your callback was
assigned to <code>onload</code>.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately, there is a cleaner way to handle this.
</p>

<h2>Using jQuery Deferred</h2>
<p>
The jQuery <a href="http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/">deferred object</a> is perfect for wrapping up asynchronous operations, such as image loading.
The deferred object provides a consistent API for adding callbacks and chaining operations.
It results in very readable code.
</p>
<p>
Here's what it's like to load an image using a jQuery deferred object.
</p>
<pre class="brush: js">$.loadImage("/my-image.png")
.done(function(image) {
  alert("Loaded image: " + image.width + "x" + image.height);
})
.fail(function(image) {
  alert("Failed to load image");
});</pre>

<p>
jQuery deferred's are easy to chain together using the <code>pipe</code> function.
For example, imagine we need the dimensions of a user's avatar image.
But first we need to the image URL from a profile retrieved via ajax...
</p>
<pre class="brush: js">var avatarDimensions = $.get("/user-profile")
  .pipe(function(profile) {
    return $.loadImage(profile.avatarUrl);
  })
  .pipe(function(avatarImage) {
    return { width: avatarImage.width, height: avatarImage.height };
  });

// avatarDimensions is a deferred object.
avatarDimensions.done(function(dimensions) {
  console.log(dimensions);
});</pre>

<h2>Implementing $.loadImage</h2>
<p>
Here's the code for <code>$.loadImage</code>.
It assumes you have already included jQuery 1.5 or newer in your page.
</p>
<pre class="brush: js">$.loadImage = function(url) {
  // Define a "worker" function that should eventually resolve or reject the deferred object.
  var loadImage = function(deferred) {
    var image = new Image();
    
    // Set up event handlers to know when the image has loaded
    // or fails to load due to an error or abort.
    image.onload = loaded;
    image.onerror = errored; // URL returns 404, etc
    image.onabort = errored; // IE may call this if user clicks "Stop"
    
    // Setting the src property begins loading the image.
    image.src = url;
    
    function loaded() {
      unbindEvents();
      // Calling resolve means the image loaded sucessfully and is ready to use.
      deferred.resolve(image);
    }
    function errored() {
      unbindEvents();
      // Calling reject means we failed to load the image (e.g. 404, server offline, etc).
      deferred.reject(image);
    }
    function unbindEvents() {
      // Ensures the event callbacks only get called once.
      image.onload = null;
      image.onerror = null;
      image.onabort = null;
    }
  };
  
  // Create the deferred object that will contain the loaded image.
  // We don't want callers to have access to the resolve() and reject() methods, 
  // so convert to "read-only" by calling `promise()`.
  return $.Deferred(loadImage).promise();
};</pre>
