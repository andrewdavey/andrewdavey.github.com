title: Going Postal - Generating email with ASP.NET MVC View Engines
---
<h2>
    Preamble</h2>
<p>
    The .NET framework provides a simple API for sending email. I assume you are already
    acquainted with the handy namespace <samp>System.Net.Mail</samp>. However, dynamically generating
    the content of an email is still a bit tricky. Code that concatenates strings and
    variables is no fun to write or read!</p>
<p>
    What we need is a way to write text (or html) templates which will be rendered with
    some data. ASP.NET MVC already has exactly this in the form of Views. So let's reuse
    the view engine infrastructure to create our emails.</p>
<p>
    I created a simple library called <a href="https://github.com/andrewdavey/postal">Postal</a>
    that does just that. Read on to find out more.</p>
<h2>
    Postal in action</h2>
<p>
    First, let's see what an email view will look like. I'm using the excellent Razor
    view engine (coming with MVC3).</p>
<p>
    <samp>Example.cshtml</samp></p>
<code>
    <pre class="brush: plain">To: @View.To
From: example@website.com
Subject: @View.Subject

Hello,
This email was generated using Postal for asp.net mvc on @View.Date.ToShortDateString()
Message follows:
@View.Message

Thanks!</pre>
</code>
<p>
    This email is just plain text, but it could contain HTML instead for richer formatting
    options.</p>
<p>
    Notice also that we are defining some email headers (To, From, Subject) at the top.
    Postal makes it easy to define everything about the email in a single file, rather
    than having to set the headers in code. Postal will parse the headers out of the
    rendered view and apply them to the outgoing email message.</p>
<p>
    Since this is a regular Razor view, we can use the handy
    <samp>View</samp>
    dynamic object to access view data. This data is populated from code. Let's see
    an example controller action that will send this email.</p>
<code>
    <pre class="brush: csharp">public ActionResult Send(string to, string subject, string message)
{
    dynamic email = new Email("Example");
    email.To = to;
    email.Subject = subject;
    email.Message = message;
    email.Date = DateTime.UtcNow;

    sender.Send(email);

    return RedirectToAction("Sent");
}
</pre>
</code>
<p>
    This code creates a new Email object, passing the name of the email view to use.
    Postal will look for email views in
    <samp>~/Views/Emails/</samp>. So our email view is at
    <samp>~/Views/Emails/Example.cshtml</samp>.</p>
<p>
    We've typed the Email object as dynamic. This lets us define the properties we want
    at runtime, without having to create an explicit view model class. I like this lightweight
    approach. (If you don't, feel free to send me a pull request!)</p>
<p>
    The Email object is building up a
    <samp>ViewDataDictionary</samp>
    internally, ready to send to the view for rendering.</p>
<p>
    Once the email object is ready to send, we're calling the
    <samp>sender</samp>
    object. This is a field of the controller.</p>
<code>
    <pre class="brush: csharp">public class HomeController : Controller
{
    // In real code this should be injected by an IoC container.
    IEmailSender sender = new EmailSender(ViewEngines.Engines);

    // ... action methods here ...
}
</pre>
</code>
<p>
    The EmailSender manages finding the view, rendering the text, parsing the headers
    and finally sending the email.</p>
<p>
    Email is sent using the System.Net.Mail.SmtpClient class. You can configure the
    SMTP settings in web.config. For example, we can simple write the emails to a folder
    for testing purposes.</p>
<code>
    <pre class="brush: xml">&lt;configuration&gt;
    &lt;system.net&gt;
        &lt;mailSettings&gt;
            &lt;smtp deliveryMethod=&quot;SpecifiedPickupDirectory&quot;&gt;
                &lt;specifiedPickupDirectory pickupDirectoryLocation=&quot;c:\email&quot;/&gt;
                &lt;network host=&quot;localhost&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;/smtp&gt;
        &lt;/mailSettings&gt;
    &lt;/system.net&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;
</pre>
</code>

    Postal is something I put together in an afternoon. So the usual warnings about
    code you find on the internet apply! That said, head over to GitHub and grab the
    source:</p>
<p>
    <a href="https://github.com/andrewdavey/postal">https://github.com/andrewdavey/postal</a></p>
<p>There's a sample project in there as well that puts the code from this post together
into a basic web application.</p>
<p>
    If you want to change Postal, fix bugs, etc, please fork the repository and send me
    pull requests. I love to see people getting involved with open source projects.
