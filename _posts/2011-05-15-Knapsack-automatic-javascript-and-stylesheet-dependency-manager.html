title: Knapsack - Automatic JavaScript and stylesheet dependency management for ASP.NET
---
<p>
Are you wasting time correctly ordering, concatenating and minifying your JavaScript? How about debugging that 10,000 line minified script? <a href="http://aboutcode.net/knapsack/">Knapsack</a> solves all these problems. It's easy to install (via nuget) and provides some fun extras, like CoffeeScript support!
</p>
<p>Knapsack is a new open source project. It's an answer to my <a href="http://aboutcode.net/2011/04/12/managing-javascript.html">previous rant</a> about managing JavaScript in an ASP.NET web application.</p>
<p>Say goodbye to maintaining JavaScript build files - Knapsack determines the correct order of files.</p>
<p>In debug-mode, Knapsack lets you debug against the original scripts. In production-mode, minified, cache-friendly, script modules are generated instead. This is config controlled, so not a single source change is needed.</p>
<p>Head over the the project home page <a href="http://aboutcode.net/knapsack/">aboutcode.net/knapsack</a> to get started with Knapsack.</p>
