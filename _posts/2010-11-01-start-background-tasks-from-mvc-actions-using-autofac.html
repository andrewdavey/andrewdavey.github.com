title: Start background tasks from MVC actions using Autofac
---
<p>This post is for people who know about ASP.NET MVC and IoC containers.</p>
<h2>Preamble</h2>
<p>Your MVC actions should be quick to return a response to the user. Any long
running task should be run on a background thread. This reduces the chance of 
your web server becoming unresponsive.</p>
<p>I'm using <a href="http://code.google.com/p/autofac">Autofac</a> as my IoC container in ASP.NET MVC projects. In addition to an application wide, global 
container, Autofac provides a "http request scoped" container for each web 
request. This means we can declare dependencies such as database connections 
to be "HTTP Request Scoped". Each request gets its own instance. At the end of 
the request, Autofac knows to dispose of any disposable objects.</p>
<p>This works very well, until you don't have an HTTP request to work within. 
Which is what happens when running some code on a background thread.</p>
<p>So we need a way to start our background task from a controller action
method, but give it a <em>new</em> request-style context. It will not have an
actual HTTP context. We'll pass any required information to the task when 
starting it.</p>
<h2>Code time</h2>
<p>To allow controller actions to start background tasks, I will pass an 
instance of the following interface into the controller via the constructor.</p>
<code><pre class="brush: csharp">
public interface IAsyncRunner
{
    void Run&lt;T&gt;(Action&lt;T&gt; action);
}
</pre></code>
<p>Remember, I'm using Autofac to create my controllers. So the constructor 
parameters are resolved from the container. An example controller looks like
this:</p>
<code><pre class="brush: csharp">
public class HomeController : Controller {
    public HomeController(IAsyncRunner async) {
        this.async = async;
    }
    readonly IAsyncRunner async;
}
</pre></code>
<p>For this example, imagine we want to do heavy image processing in response 
to a file being uploaded. Our action method will be:</p>
<code><pre class="brush: csharp">
public ActionResult UploadImage(HttpPostedFileBase image) {
    image.SaveAs("example.jpg");
    async.Run&lt;ImageResizer&gt;(resizer => resizer.Resize("example.jpg"));
    return RedirectToAction("UploadFinished");
}
</pre></code>
<p>That's a nice short method, but let's analyse the details.</p>
<p>First, we synchronously write the raw image data to disk. Then we call then 
async runner's Run method. We provide the type of the object to be invoked and 
a delegate to run. The async runner will start a new 
background task, create an ImageResizer object and call the given delegate.</p>
<p>In the meantime the action method is free to return a response to the 
user.</p>
<h2>The AsyncRunner</h2>
<p>Let's move onto to the actual AsyncRunner implementation. I'm using Autofac,
but the code could be adapted for use with any IoC container.</p>
<code><pre class="brush: csharp">
public class AsyncRunner : IAsyncRunner
{
    public void Run&lt;T&gt;(Action&lt;T&gt; action)
    {
        var app = GetApplicationContainer();
        Task.Factory.StartNew(delegate
        {
            // Create a nested container which will use the same dependency
            // registrations as set for HTTP request scopes.
            using (var container = app.BeginLifetimeScope(WebLifetime.Request))
            {
                var service = container.Resolve&lt;T&gt;();
                action(service);
            }
        });
    }

    IContainer GetApplicationContainer()
    {
        // Use Autofac's ASP.NET integration to get the application-wide
        // container that exists in the ApplicationInstance.
        // See the Autofac documentation for more about this.
        var accessor = ((IContainerProviderAccessor)HttpContext.Current.ApplicationInstance);
        return accessor.ContainerProvider.ApplicationContainer;
    }
}
</pre></code>
<p>The AsyncRunner uses Autofac to create an instance of the requested type T.
This happens inside a new "lifetime scope". By using Autofac to create the 
object, that object can also declare dependencies to be provided by the 
container.</p>
<p>The .NET 4.0 Task Parallel Library is used to start a new task to run 
within, rather than worry about creating threads manually.</p>
<p>The end result is a clean way to start asynchronous tasks, whilst still 
being able to use Autofac's excellent features.</p>
